## Original Project Purpose

This project was created to provide students with a faster, more responsive, and mobile-friendly alternative to the official university web calendar. The original calendar, while functional, could be slow to load and difficult to navigate on a phone. This viewer solved that by efficiently pre-processing the public calendar data and displaying it in a clean, dark-mode interface.

The official calendar, which was the source of all data for this project, can be found at: **[cal.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr](https://cal.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr/master/)**
